            <p class="tozai-bio-description">
                Tozai Home was started in England by John Ayris and Anne Spratling in 1991. On a trip through Asia in the early nineties they met a talented man who had a beautiful wooden pig for sale, hand-carved from a tree he had grown himself. They bought the pig
                and several other pieces and took them home as gifts for friends and family. The gifts were so well received and demand for them so great, they decided to start their own business introducing these beautiful handmade goods to the UK and
                Tozai Home was born.</span> Throughout its history, Tozai Home has been at the forefront of bringing you beautifully designed, home and gift items crafted by masters from across the globe. <br><br> From Paris to Bangkok,
                London to New York, <br> the Tozai Home collections are contemporary adaptions with a distinctive style, sustaining the continuation of some of the world’s oldest techniques and artisans. <br> Color and texture packed with sophisticated
                design and the highest quality manufacturing - that is what a Tozai piece will bring to your product selection!
